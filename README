FolderMonitor is a GUI application, which demonstrates statistics of selected folder (including subdirectories count, overall files size etc).It's a simple demo program with own limitations (something like doubling hardlinks info, skipping soft links, "snapshoting" structure of 
file system)
TODO: 
1) Add support of monitoring/updating file system changes (QFileSystemWatcher class)
2) Add caching of statistics into model data (it can be stored on disk or in-memory data)
